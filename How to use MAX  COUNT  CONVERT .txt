We define an employee's total earnings to be their monthly SALARY* MONTHS  worked, and the maximum total earnings to be the maximum total earnings for any employee in the Employee table. Write a query to find the maximum total earnings for all employees as well as the total number of employees who have maximum total earnings. Then print these values as  space-separated integers.


select max(salary*months), count(salary*months)
from employee
where salary*months in 
(select max(salary*months) from employee)

下面的容易理解：

select CONVERT(VARCHAR(100), salary*months) + ' ' + CONVERT(VARCHAR(100), count(*))
from employee
where salary*months IN
(select max(salary*months) from employee)
GROUP BY salary*months


***************
MAX 
COUNT 
CONVERT 


SELECT 'A' + 'C' + 'B'
SELECT CONVERT(VARCHAR(10), 1) + 'C' + CONVERT(VARCHAR(10), 2)
SELECT 1 + 'C' + 2
SELECT '1' + 'C' + '2'
